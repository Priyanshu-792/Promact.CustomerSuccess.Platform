# Customer Success Platform Documentation

## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to create a Customer Success Platform designed to streamline the notification process for stakeholders regarding system updates or modifications. This tool is intended to bolster communication and transparency by promptly sharing pertinent updates with all involved parties.

## Project Overview

A Customer Success Platform represents a structured blueprint detailing the goals, extent, parties involved, and primary outcomes of a project. It acts as a fundamental reference point, offering lucidity and guidance to all parties involved in the project, be it team members, sponsors, or clients. The typical constituents of a Customer Success Platform encompass:

## Purpose

The Customer Success Platform serves as a roadmap, elucidating project goals, boundaries, and stakeholders, thereby maintaining project focus and ensuring desired results are achieved.

## Technology Requirements

### Frontend

For the frontend, we require a single-page application framework like Angular. Angular provides a robust framework for building dynamic web applications with features such as data binding, dependency injection, and reusable components.

### Backend

For the backend, we need to utilize ABP.IO, which stands out as one of the best frameworks available. ABP.IO simplifies the development process with its modular architecture, built-in authentication, authorization, and support for multi-tenancy.

## Database

PostgreSQL will serve as our database management system. PostgreSQL offers reliability, scalability, and robust support for complex queries and transactions. It's an ideal choice for storing our project data and tables securely.

## Requirements for Running Angular Project Locally

To start working on the Angular project locally, ensure that you have the following requirements installed and set up:

### Node.js and npm

- **Node.js:** Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), from the official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm:** npm is installed automatically with Node.js. Verify npm installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

### Angular CLI

Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool used to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. Install Angular CLI globally via npm:

-bash
npm install -g @angular/cli


## About the backend in ABP Framework

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the ABP Framework. All the fundamental ABP modules are already installed. 

### Pre-requirements

* [.NET 8.0+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
* [Node v18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Configurations

The solution comes with a default configuration that works out of the box. However, you may consider to change the following configuration before running your solution:

* Check the `ConnectionStrings` in `appsettings.json` files under the `Promact.CustomerSuccess.Platform` project and change it if you need.

### Before running the application

#### Generating a Signing Certificate

In the production environment, you need to use a production signing certificate. ABP Framework sets up signing and encryption certificates in your application and expects an `openiddict.pfx` file in your application.

This certificate is already generated by ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to generate it yourself. However, if you need to generate a certificate, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -v -ep openiddict.pfx -p a2a5a8af-14c6-4374-a8f3-908165814c47
```

> `a2a5a8af-14c6-4374-a8f3-908165814c47` is the password of the certificate, you can change it to any password you want.

It is recommended to use **two** RSA certificates, distinct from the certificate(s) used for HTTPS: one for encryption, one for signing.

For more information, please refer to: https://documentation.openiddict.com/configuration/encryption-and-signing-credentials.html#registering-a-certificate-recommended-for-production-ready-scenarios

> Also, see the [Configuring OpenIddict](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Deployment/Configuring-OpenIddict#production-environment) documentation for more information.

#### Install Client-Side Libraries

Run the following command in the directory of your final application:

```bash
abp install-libs
```

> This command installs all NPM packages for MVC/Razor Pages and Blazor Server UIs and this command is already run by the ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to run this command manually.

### How to Run

The application needs to connect to a database. Run the following command in the `Promact.CustomerSuccess.Platform` directory to migrate the database and seed the initial data:

````bash
dotnet run --migrate-database
````

This command will create and seed the initial database. Then you can run the application with any IDE that supports .NET.

### Deploying the application

Deploying an ABP application is not different than deploying any .NET or ASP.NET Core application. However, there are some topics that you should care about when you are deploying your applications. You can check ABP's [Deployment documentation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Deployment/Index) before deploying your application.


## Project Requirements
1. **Email Notification System:**
   - Implement functionality to send email notifications to stakeholders upon any change or update within the application.
